# Challenge [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fhello-world)

Deploy it on **Vercel** 👆

## About:

This repo create a simple todo list, creating, updating and deleting **tasks**,
includes a simple Login from **Auth0**, and subcribe information from backend.
permissions are manage by **Auth0** too.

Data is stored in **Dgraph**, and manage through **GraphQL**.
information are **subscribed** and handled into a state manager (**recoil**), this could cause a small response **issue**,
but simplify the code and show us what is exactly store in the database in **real time**.

Disclaimer 🤔:

- Backend was not pretended to be done, but it was in a simple way.
- Subscriptions make simple

- **Redux** has been replaced by **Recoil**, if you are familiar with `useState` , then you will find it really easy to use/

- **Vercel** testing and a couple `Test` to evaluated,code enforced using TS

- and much **more** 😎
